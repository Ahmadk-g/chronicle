# Design

## Color Scheme

The color palette used across the site is inspired by the vibrant tones of our logo, creating a visually cohesive and engaging experience. To enhance usability and guide user interaction, different shades of these core colors are applied strategically throughout the app. From subtle background hues to dynamic hover effects, each color and shade is chosen to complement the design and improve user experience based on context and functionality. 

![Palette](documentation/colorpalette.png)

Below is a breakdown of the primary colors and their contextual usage:

**Primary Colors**
- **Main Background** `#f8f8f8`: Used as the primary background color across the app for a clean and neutral base.
- **Content Background** `#ffffff`: Applied to cards, containers, and main content areas to maintain a bright and focused look.

**Intercative Elements**
- **Navbar Icons**: Default `#a5a4a7`, Hover `#ff76f4`, Active `#802ac7`
- **Buttons**: 
  - Primary: `#76bbfa`
  - Following: `#9671ee`
  - Comment Post: Default `#9671ee`, Hover `#cfced3`
  - Event Attending: Default `#000`, Hover `#ff76f4`, Active `#a02ac7`

Text colors are also dynamically adjusted to ensure strong contrast and optimal readability across various backgrounds. This thoughtful approach ensures a harmonious and accessible interface, while maintaining consistency with the brand's identity.


## Fonts

The primary font used throughout the site is **DM Sans**, which provides a clean and modern look, enhancing readability and aesthetics. 

To ensure consistency, **sans-serif** is designated as a backup font, serving as a fallback in cases where the primary font fails to load correctly.

## Agile Methodologies

Chronicle was developed using Agile methodology, fostering iterative development and adaptability throughout the project. The use of GitHub Projects and Issues allowed for efficient task management via a Kanban-style board. This approach facilitated the organization of tasks into Epics, User Stories, and actionable Tasks, ensuring continuous progress tracking and a user-focused final product.


### Epics and User Stories

- **Epics**: Represent large features or overarching objectives, broken down into smaller, actionable components to enable a structured and manageable development process.

- **User Stories**: Define specific functionalities or features from a user's perspective, with clear acceptance criteria to ensure completeness. Each user story often comprises several tasks that need to be completed to meet the user’s needs.

You can explore the project's epics and user stories on the [GitHub Kanban Board](https://github.com/users/Ahmadk-g/projects/5).

### MoSCoW Prioritization

To manage priorities and allocate resources effectively, the MoSCoW method was used, categorizing tasks as follows:

- **Must Have**: Essential features that are critical for the app’s core functionality.
- **Should Have**: Important features that enhance user experience but are not immediately critical.
- **Could Have**: Desirable features addressed only after "Must Have" and "Should Have" requirements are completed.
- **Won’t Have**: Features not considered for the initial release but potentially included in future updates.

### Kanban Board
A Kanban board was utilized for visualizing the workflow, tracking the status of user stories, and ensuring efficient task management. The board highlights tasks in various stages: To Do, In Progress, and Completed, promoting transparency and streamlined development.

You can view the project's Kanban board [here](https://github.com/users/Ahmadk-g/projects/5).

##  Database Schema - Entity relationship Diagram

### **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD**)
The ERD visually maps out the relationships and dependencies among various entities in the system. It provides a clear representation of how users interact with posts, events, and other users, while also highlighting the notification and social engagement processes. This diagram acts as a blueprint for developers, making it easier to understand the data flow and identify key relationships within the application. 

[dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io) was utilized to design the ERD.

![Chronicle ERD](documentation/erd.png)


### **Key Model Relationships**

- Users:
  - **Profile**: Extends the default Django User model with additional fields for personalization.
  - **Followers**: Creates a many-to-many relationship, enabling users to follow and unfollow one another, fostering a social network.

- Posts:
  - **User-generated content**: Posts include text, images, and multimedia to encourage user engagement.
  - **Likes and Comments**: Linked to Likes and Comments for user interaction with posts, enabling likes and threaded discussions.
  - **Notifications**: Post interactions trigger notifications, keeping users updated on likes, comments, and more.
  - **Timestamps**: Tracks creation and update times, ensuring content freshness.

- Followers
  - **User Connections**: Manages who follows whom by using two ForeignKey fields, creating a many-to-many relationship between users.
  - **Notifications**: Following users triggers notifications, alerting new followers and activity.
  - **Dynamic Relationship**: Users can follow and unfollow at any time, with real-time updates.

- Notifications:
  - **Event-Driven**: Triggered by user actions (likes, comments, follows, event participation) to keep users informed.
  - **Notification Types**: Flexible notification_type field allows new notification types to be added easily.
  - **User-Centric**: Notifications are linked to users, ensuring personalized updates.

- Events:
  - **User-Generated**: Users create events for social gatherings, online meetups, etc.
  - **RSVP & Status**: Tracks participation with statuses like "interested" or "attending" via the Attending model.
  - **Notifications**: Event updates trigger notifications to participants and hosts.
  - **Timestamps**: Events have start and end times to track scheduling.

- Interactions
  - **Likes, Comments & Attendings**: Users interact with posts and events through likes, comments, and attending statuses.
  - **Nested Comments**: Supports threaded comments for deeper discussions.
  - **Dynamic Updates**: Interactions update in real-time, with notifications for new likes, comments, followers or event RSVP's.

<br>

### **Entity Relationships Overview:**
- **One-to-One:** Each user profile is uniquely tied to a Django User model instance.
- **One-to-Many:** 
  - Users can create multiple posts, comments, likes, or events.
  - Posts can have multiple comments and likes.
- **Many-to-Many:**
  - Follower relationships enable users to connect with each other.
  - Event attendance is facilitated through intermediary models.

<br>  

<u>Comprehnsive Relationship Table</u>

| Primary Model |  Related Model | Relationship Type | Description |
|---------|---------|----------|------------------|
| User | Profile | One-to-One | Each user has one profile. |
| User | Post | One-to-Many | One user can create multiple posts. |
| User | Event | One-to-Many | One user can create multiple events. |
| User | Comment | One-to-Many | One user can create multiple comments. |

| Notification | Post | Many-to-One | Many Notifications belong can be associated with one post |
| Notification | Events | Many-to-One | Many Notifications belong can be associated with one event |

<br>

## Security
Security is essential for protecting user data and platform integrity.

- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data, including passwords and personal information, is encrypted to prevent unauthorized access.
- **CSRF Tokens**: Each form submission includes a CSRF token to guard against cross-site request forgery attacks.
- **Authentication**: User authentication is managed by Django AllAuth, ensuring secure user registration and login.
- **API Security**: The API is protected with token-based authentication, limiting actions like creating posts or updating profiles to authenticated users. Superuser permissions are required for admin actions.

This ensures a secure experience for all users on the platform.
